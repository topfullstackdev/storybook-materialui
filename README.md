# Components

This is the primary component library for the monorepo.

## Create new component

Run `yarn generate:component` to generate a new component. This will add the component to the components-main lib with the correct file and folder structure.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn test components-main` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
